bootstrap-mods
==============

Adds a few very necessary features to Twitter's Bootstrap 3, including 5, 7, and 8 column grid options and breakpoint-sensitive floating. Just the essentials.

## Classes

.col-[1-5]-5<br/>
.col-[1-7]-7<br/>
.col-[1-8]-8<br/>
.pull-left-[xs-lg]<br/>
.pull-right-[xs-lg]<br/>

That's all for now...
